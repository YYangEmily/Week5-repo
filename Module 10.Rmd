H0: Vervets trapped in 2016 are not heavier than Vervets trapped earlier seasons. <br>
HA: Vervets trapped in 2016 are heavier than Vervets trapped earlier seasons.<br>
Hypothesis: upper one-tailed test <br>
Calculate the mean, standard deviation, and SEM from our sample<br>


```{r Upper test}
mu <- 4.9
x <- d$weight
m <- mean(x)
s <- sd(x)
n <- length(x)
sem <- s/sqrt(n)
